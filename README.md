# University-Haskell-String-Analyser-Library
Haskell University project

Was created for my Advanced Software Engineering coursework and developed with the Haskell Atom Package (https://atom.io/packages/atom-haskell). 
Was my first use of Haskell, and functional programming.

The purpose of this application was to insert strings and retrieve analytical data. 
This includes specific character counts (Vowels, Consonants, Numbers etc)
  
The library also includes functionality that transformed strings and output them to a text-file

The idea was to create a tool that could locally edit and analyse large bodies of text and provide useful outputs.
As Haskell is a more functional, command line based language it is difficult to implement a clean user interface compared to java or c++ so rather
than a fully fleshed-out program it was created as a set of libraries.
